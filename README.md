# Project Red Tie specification

**Project Red Tie** (full name TBD) is a specification and implementation for an efficient representation of the Minecraft protocol between a Minecraft server and a Minecraft proxy. It is being jointly developed by a team of volunteers who are passionate about pushing Minecraft to its limits.

We intend to produce a specification that any server or proxy implementation can implement - this specification is independent of Velocity or Minestom.

## Current progress
